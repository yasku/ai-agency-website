## ðŸš¦ Development Guidelines

### Component Architecture Rules:
1. **Default to Server Components** for static content
2. **Use Client Components (`'use client'`)** only for:
   - Form handling
   - Interactive animations
   - Browser API usage
   - State management

### Design System Compliance:
- âœ… **Colors**: Use semantic `foreground`, `background`, `text-foreground/70`
- âœ… **Buttons**: Maintain `rounded-full` with established hover states
- âœ… **Spacing**: Consistent `gap-[32px]`, `gap-[48px]` patterns
- âœ… **Borders**: `border-black/[.08] dark:border-white/[.145]`
- âœ… **Typography**: Follow established hierarchy with Geist fonts
- âœ… **Responsive**: Mobile-first with `sm:` breakpoints

### Quality Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint zero warnings/errors
- Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Performance: Lighthouse score > 90
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Testing Protocol:
- Test on mobile (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Test on desktop (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test both light and dark modes
- Verify keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
