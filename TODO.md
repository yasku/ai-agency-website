# Navigation Bar Implementation TODO

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive navigation bar for the AI Agency website that follows established design system patterns, maintains consistency with existing components, and provides excellent UX/UI experience across all devices.

## Design System Reference
- **Colors**: CSS variables (`--background`, `--foreground`) with opacity modifiers (`/70`, `/80`)
- **Typography**: Geist Sans/Mono fonts with gradient text effects (`bg-gradient-to-r from-foreground to-foreground/70`)
- **Spacing**: Semantic patterns (`gap-[24px]`, `gap-[32px]`, `gap-[48px]`)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first with `sm:` breakpoint (640px+)
- **Interactions**: React 19 hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useTransition`)
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
